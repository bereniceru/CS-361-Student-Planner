### Inclusivity Heuristics Implementation

**IH#1 - Explain Benefits**: Homepage provides clear overview of functionality with visible to-do list and quick note features

**IH#2 - Explain Costs**: Streamlined task creation requires only essential information (name, date, time)

**IH#3 - Information Control**: Multiple viewing formats (calendar, planner, to-do list) let users choose their preferred organization method

**IH#4 - Familiar Features**: Consistent navigation patterns and button placement across all screens

**IH#5 - Undo/Redo Available**: Task completion checking and edit functionality for easy modification

**IH#6 - Explicit Task Path**: Clear sequence from viewing tasks → creating tasks → form completion

**IH#7 - Try Different Approaches**: Calendar view vs. planner view options for different user preferences

**IH#8 - Mindful Tinkering**: Flexible usage allowing users to focus on specific features (to-do only) or explore full functionality

##  Current Status

**Phase**: Design and Planning, implementation in progress. 


## Prototype:

### 1. Main Menu
Main Menu featuring navigation options, to-do list preview, and quick note functionality

### 2. Planner View  
List-based activity overview with chronological organization and listed tasks 

### 3. Calendar View
Traditional calendar interface for date-based planning

### 4. Schedule Creator
Easy task creation microservice, will likely use SQLite


## Design Tools

- **Wireframing & Sitemap**: Microsoft Visio
- **Design Documentation**: Inclusivity Heuristics Framework
